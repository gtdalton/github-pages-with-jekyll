# Medical AI Network

On Tueaday I attended a meeting of people interested in learning about AI and its use in healthcare.
About twenty people showed up for some netowrking over drinks and snacks, sharing their experiences.
Most attendees were either junior doctors, medical students or computer science students.
I had a particularl interesting conversation with Tariq, an astrophysics PhD student,
who was exploring the possibility of whether his machine learning techniques for analysing images of space could be applied to medical imaging such as MRI or CT.
Intelligently constructing high resolution images from lower ones could have big implcations for the radiation dose patients recieve (CT) and the time it takes to perform a scan (MRI).

The paper we discussed was about <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01631?fbclid=IwAR3S0ri5nuBiHuEt63C6keGgqP4d4Q4GsFO3NpRsmcjsISOIsssqckyj4fo'>Neonatal Pain Detection</a>
using transfer learning of a convulsional neural network trained on ImageNet to retrain on babies faces to detect pain.
As a group, we rated the paper 2.9/7
The paper had nice narrative elements that explianed some of the methods well.
We felt that the paper was clinically dubious in some areas, used some statistical test inapproporiately, and failed to report adequate information about data set balance.

I look forward to attending the next event.
